**Description:**  
This is a small project to develop my skills using python. Here I would like to replicate the classic game called "Snake" and use Pythonin a different way then only automation for my everyday tasks. The features in this game will be capped to it's minimum. For more questions or feedback feel free to email me. [[Email](Jordijaspers@gmail.com "e-mail")
